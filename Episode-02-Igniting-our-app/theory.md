# Notes:

## What is a production ready code?
- Current code should not be deployed to production.
- The code should not have **comments**.
- The code should not have `console.log`.
- The code should be **minified**.
- The code should be **bundled**.
- The code should be **compressed**.
- If an app has images, the images should be optimized.
- There you need to do:
    - **Bundling**
    - **Code splitting**
    - **Chunking**
    - **Image optimization**
    - **Compression**
    - **Minification**
    - **Print Removal** `console.log`
> React alone cannot make a production ready app.

## What is npm?
- Abbreviation of **npm** is not ~~Node Package Manager~~.
- npm does not have a fullform.
- Although it is a package manager which manages Node packages.
- npm is used to install **packages** or **dependencies**.

## What is package.json?
- It is a configuration file for the npm in JSON format.
- It keeps the **metadata** about the project including **_name_**, **_version_**, **_description_**, **_entry point_**, **_scripts_** and most importantly a list of **_dependencies_**.
- npm stores the **version ranges** of different packages / dependencies in the package.json.
- It does not store exact versions of packages.
- It stores the package and its version range as **key-value** pair in the package.json.
- It keeps a **Caret** (`^`) & **Tilde** (`~`) to maintain the versions.
- There are two types of dependencies:
    - **Dev dependencies** (`devDependencies`)
    - **Normal dependencies** (`dependencies`)
- **Dev dependencies** are required for the development of the application.
- **Normal dependencies** are required in the production also.
- It is human readable and is intended for developers to manually edit and configure.
- It is often shared in the GIT.
- Command to create a package.json:
```
npm init
```
- This command will prompt questions seeking information related the project.
- The answers from the User will be stored as metadata.

## What is packge-lock.json?
- This file is automatically generated when `npm install` command is run.
- It locks the dependency tree.
- It ensures that the **exact versions** of dependencies and sub-dependencies are installed everytime.
- It is not intended to edit manually.
- It is also shared in the GIT.

## Difference between Caret (`^`) and Tilde (`~`)?
- **Caret (`^`)**
    - It allows updates within the same **major version**.
    - It allows updates that **do not change** the **leftmost non-zero** digit.
    - It ensures **backward-compatibility** within the same major version.
    - E.g.
        - Package version `^1.2.3` matches `1.x.x`
        - `x` can be anything `>=2.3`
        - `1.2.4` & `1.3.0` etc. will match.
        - `2.0.0` will not match.
- **Tilde (`^`)**
    - It allows updates within the same **minor version**.
    - It allows updates only for the **patch version** (or the **minor version** if no patch version is specified).
    - It restricts the updates to only **patch-level** changes.
    - It ensures greater stability while allowing some flexibility.
    - E.g.
        - Package version `~1.2.3` matches `1.2.x`
        - `x` can be anything `>=3`
        - `1.2.4` & `1.2.5` etc. will match.
        - `1.3.0` will not match.
    - E.g.
        - Packge version `~1.2` will match `1.2.x`.
        - `1.2.0` & `1.2.1` etc. will match.
        - `1.3.x` will not match.

## What is a Bundler?
- The most important package in any project.
- Before moving the code to production, the code need to be cleaned, minified, cached and bundled.
- The Bundler is the package which makes all these changes to the code.
- E.g. of a Bundlers is **_Webpack_**, **_Parcel_**, **_Vite_**.
- This project will use **_Parcel_** as a Bundler.
- Command:
```
npm install parcel
```
- Since parcel is used to bundle the developed code.
- Therefore, the Parcel will not be required on the production.
- Hence, it should be installed as a `devDependency`.
- Command:
```
npm install -D parcel
```

## What are node_modules?
- The Packages installed using npm are downloaded and kept as `node_modules`.
- `node_modules` are kept inside the project directory.
- Every installed dependency has its own list of dependencies. Further those list of dependencies has their list.
- This process continues for all the dependencies and ultimately a **Dependency Tree** is created.
- Therefore, these are called as **Transitive Dependencies**.

## How many package.json & packge-lock.json can be there in a project?
- Since, dependencies are transitive i.e. every package has it own list of dependencies.
- Every package keeps its own package.json.
- Hence, there can be multiple package.json and package-lock.json in a project.

## Is the node_modules folder required in the project's GIT repository?
- **No**
- It should be ignored in the GIT using `.gitignore`.
- This is not mandatory because it can be recreated using the package.json and package-lock.json.

## Should you keep the package.json and the package-lock.json in the GIT?
- **Yes**
- These files will be required to install the exact dependencies with their exact versions in the project.
- Which will create the node_modules as well.

## What is .gitignore file?
- Some files are not required to be pushed to the GIT repository.
- These files are ignore from the GIT using the `.gitignore` file.
- Individual files, Folders and even patterns can be configured in the `.gitignore` file.
